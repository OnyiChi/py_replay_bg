def ada_hypotreatments_handler(glucose, cho, hypotreatments, bolus, basal, time, time_index, dss):
    """
    Implements the default hypotreatment strategy: "take an hypotreatment of 10 g every 15 minutes while in hypoglycemia".

    Parameters
    ----------
    glucose: array
        An array vector as long the simulation length containing all the simulated glucose concentrations (mg/dl)
        up to time_index. The values after time_index should be ignored.
    cho: array
        An array vector as long the simulation length containing all the cho intakes (g/min) up to time_index.
        It does not contain hypotreatment intakes. The values after time_index should be ignored.
    hypotreatments: array
        An array vector as long the simulation length containing all the hypotreatment intakes (g/min) up to time_index.
        If the scenario is single meal, hypotreatments will contain only the hypotreatments generated by this function
        during the simulation. If the scenario is multi-meal, hypotreatments will ALSO contain the hypotreatments already
        present in the given data that labeled as such. The values after time_index should be ignored.
    bolus: array
        An array vector as long the simulation length containing all the insulin boluses (U/min) up to time_index.
        The values after time_index should be ignored.
    basal: array
        An array vector as long the simulation length containing all the insulin basal (U/min) up to time_index.
        The values after time_index should be ignored.
    time: array
        An array vector as long the simulation length containing the time corresponding to the current step (hours) up to time_index.
        The values after time_index should be ignored.
    time_index: int
        The index corresponding to the current simulation step of the replay simulation.
    dss: DSS
        An object that represents the hyperparameters of the integrated decision support system.

    Returns
    -------
    ht: float
        The hypotreatment to administer at time[time_index+1].
    dss: DSS
        An object that represents the hyperparameters of the integrated decision support system.
        dss is also an output since it contains hypotreatments_handler_params that beside being a
        dict that contains the parameters to pass to  this function, it also serves as memory area.
        It is possible to store values inside it and the ada_hypotreatments_handler function will be able
        to access to them in the next call of the function.

    Raises
    ------
    None
